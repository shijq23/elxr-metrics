# Contributing to eLxr Metrics Project

This project has adopted the [Contributing to the eLxr Project][elxr-project-contributor-guide] workflow.

## Overview

This workflow will walk you through how to contribute, whether youâ€™re an internal developer or an external contributor. The eLxr project uses GitLab for version control. All code and documents submissions go through a structured review process using Merge Requests (MRs).

## Workflow

The workflow includes all necessary steps for setting up a GitLab account, forking the repository, creating branches, running CI pipelines, editing code, and submitting MRs.

1. Setup your GitLab account. For details, see [GitLab Account Setup][setup-gitlab-for-elxr-dev].

1. Create an issue specific to your contribution. For details, see [Create an Issue for Your Contribution][create-issue-for-contribution.html].

1. Follow the contributor workflow at [Developer Contribution Workflow][external-elxr-contrib-workflow], which recommends the fork method for contributions.

1. Once development is complete, create a merge request. For details, see [Create a Merge Request (MR)][create-elxr-merge-request]. You will need to be responsive to the eLxr maintainer to ensure your request is approved and ultimately merged with the latest eLxr build.
